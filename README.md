# WatchConnectivityDemo
Watch Connectivity Demo in Swift 2

For this demo I was used WCSession and WCSessionDelegates

The demo can:
- Add a text in the iphone and send this text to appleWatch
- Remove a text from the iphone and remove this text in appleWatch

Note:
 - Watch Connectivity is available from WatchOS 2
 - Pass data between iphone and appleWatch is so different in WatchOS 1 and WatchOS 2, in WatchOS 1 use AppGroups, but in WatchOS 2 AppGroups is replace for WatchConnectivity
